            <h3>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h3>
            <p>Women empowerment is the process that creates power in women to live a respectable life in a society.<br>Women are empowered when they are able to access opportunies in a variety of fields,such as in education,profession,lifestyle,etc.,without any limitations and restrictions.<br>When a woman makes a crucial decision,she feels empowered.limiting women from seeking new opportunities and ecluding them from social,economic and political participation is wastage of human resource potential.they also need similar treatment as men and have an independent role in society.This also reduces unemployment,which is another major issue that our society faces</p>
